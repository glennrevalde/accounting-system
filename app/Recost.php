/**
 * v35: costs the later transactions of a back-dated, edited, voided or deleted inventory transaction again, in date order.
 *
 * The weighted average is worked out as each transaction is posted. A processing order, bill or sale entered with an
 * earlier date than transactions already posted, or edited, voided or deleted after later ones were posted, used to
 * leave those later ones at the costs of the moment they were entered: the averages after it jumped (a receipt costed
 * at ten times its value, then the stock sold at that inflated average, then the receipt corrected, left the average at
 * a fraction of the right one). Now every transaction with inventory movements on or after the date concerned is posted
 * again, oldest first (on one date, the stock received before the stock used or sold, Stock::dayRanks), exactly as
 * Rebuild Data does for the whole history, so the averages and the cost of sales follow the dates.
 *
 * It runs once the saving transaction is committed, in a transaction of its own: if it cannot finish, nothing of it is
 * kept and a message asks for Rebuild Data. It is skipped, with a message, when more than "auto_recost_limit"
 * transactions would be posted again (System Administration > Company, Security & Closing Date > Inventory and POS),
 * and it can be switched off there ("auto_recost").
 *
 * A new transaction dated today (a POS sale, a bill) has nothing after it and starts nothing. On one date, a receipt
 * entered after the day's sales is settled by Stock::move (the shortfall at the cost received); an edit, void or delete
 * of a transaction with later entries on its own date does start a re-costing of that date.
